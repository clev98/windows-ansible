# windows-ansible
Windows Ansible I developed and maintained for ISTS-2021 and IRSeC-2020 with a goal of being highly extensible and scalable. This is not intended to be a full playbook, but to merely store the roles for reference. This is not up to date with the current ansible standards. 

I did need to get rid of some files under files/ in some of the roles due to size, this is easily rectified.
