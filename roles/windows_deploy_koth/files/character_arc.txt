“You will be required to do wrong no matter where you go. It is the basic condition of life, to be required to violate your own identity. 
At some time, every creature which lives must do so. It is the ultimate shadow, the defeat of creation; this is the curse at work,
 the curse that feeds on all life. Everywhere in the universe.” -Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep
