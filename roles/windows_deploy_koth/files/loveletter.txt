Dear Kouki,

I'm sorry, but I cannot match the feelings you have presented to me for I am
already in a relationship with Souta. Please do not be angry, but we've met a year ago 
on the natayuki bridge. He won my heart with a bouquet of morning glorys. I hope
this reply is sufficent for your feelings, once again I am sorry.

Best Regards,
Ichika Yui
